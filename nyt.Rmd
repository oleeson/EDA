#What this does 
#####Take data from NYT web-based media and analysis click through rate by age group segmentation

```{r}
#set url as object
file <- "http://stat.columbia.edu/~rachel/datasets/nyt3.csv"
#read in nyt data
data <- read.csv(url(file))
#view output
head(data)
str(data)
```

We have downloaded and viewed our data. Now we do some EDA. 

```{r}
#create a new age group for each age given the following cut-offs: 
data$Age_Group <- cut(data$Age, c(-Inf, 18, 24, 34, 44, 54, 65, Inf))
#name levels of new age group variable
levels(data$Age_Group) <- c("<18", "18-24", "25-34", "35-44", "45-54", "55-64", "65+")
#check data again
head(data)
```

We have created our age groups. Now we want to examine click-through rate

```{r}
#create a new dataset that only holds impressions
new <- subset(data, Impressions>0)
#create a new variable for click through rate
new$CTR <- new$Clicks/new$Impressions
#what does that look like?
head(new)
```

Now let's graph some data. 

```{r}
library(ggplot2) # used for visualizations
#plot of impressions by age group
ggplot(subset(new, Impressions>0), aes(x=Impressions, fill=Age_Group))+
  geom_histogram(binwidth=1)

#Plot of click through rate by age group
ggplot(subset(new, CTR>0), aes(x=CTR, fill=Age_Group))+
   labs(title="Click-through rate by age group (05/01/2012)")+
   geom_histogram(binwidth=.025)

```
